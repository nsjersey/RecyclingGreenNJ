New Jersey Generation, Disposal and Recycling Statistics

1. Important Story. A review of NJ waste management,  on state, county, municipal performance and correlation to grant awards. 
2. Open+New Content.  See http://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/recycling/stats.htm. PDF data scraping is a tough art :-). 
3. Open-Source Required. Started upon a lightweight web app based on Ruby, Sinatra intended for GoogleDrive data use. 
4. Building it Right. PDF scraping consumed time, GoogleAPI access debugging, reverted to flat files ;-).
5. Team: Steve (Teacher) , Lori (Journalist), Alex, Joli (Journalist), Fabio
